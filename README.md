# Cook the Books

I created this app for my book, [Learn WebAssembly](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learn-webassembly).

I moved the code to [the book repo](https://github.com/mikerourke/learn-webassembly/tree/master/chapter-07-cook-the-books) so I don't have to maintain 2 different versions.
